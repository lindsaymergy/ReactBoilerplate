## Custom Front-End: With this boilerplate, you can craft unique, custom front-end designs and user experiences, tailored to your client's specific needs.

## CMS Integration: The boilerplate is designed to smoothly integrate with various CMS platforms such as HubSpot, Sitefinity, and WordPress, allowing you to port data and content from these systems with ease.

## Data Mapping and Migration: It includes tools and techniques for mapping and migrating data points, ensuring a seamless transition of content and information from the CMS to the custom front-end.

## Scalability: This boilerplate provides a scalable foundation, making it suitable for both small and large projects. It offers a well-organized project structure for maintainability and expandability.

# Objective:
The primary goal of the React CMS Boilerplate is to expedite the development process for client-side projects that require custom front-end solutions while maintaining existing CMS platforms for content management. It offers a starting point for developers to create web applications that can seamlessly pull data from CMS systems like HubSpot, Sitefinity, and WordPress.

### By using this boilerplate, developers can save time and effort in setting up the project's core structure, focusing on creating a unique and visually appealing front-end. This repository encourages collaboration, sharing best practices, and extending the boilerplate's features to adapt to different client needs and CMS platforms.

### Developers can confidently use this boilerplate as a solid foundation for web projects that demand the flexibility of custom front-end development while retaining the convenience and power of established CMS solutions.

### Run the following:

<code>
npm update

npm install
</code>

## Commands
*npm run start* - starts the dev server, including watch, and sets up hot-loading for auto-refreshing your changes as you save.  Just follow the link in the console to load the current App.

*npm run build* - outputs bundled build files that would be used in production.  Configuration is found in webpack/prod.config.js

*npm run test* - starts up jest testing environment and watch.

*npm run analyze* - opens a page with bundle analysis, showing everying in the production bundle as squares relative to size.

*npm run json* - starts a json server that can be used for quickly scaffolding data types and mocking services for components.

## Codebase
This boilerplate comes with a number of tools you can use to quickly author react components.  There are a number of components already here to get you started.
